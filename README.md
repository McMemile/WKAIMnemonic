# WaniKani AI Mnemonic Images (Userscript)

### Features
Adds AI images from this WK thread to WaniKani info pages, as well as lessons and reviews.

**Images that are uploaded here are used by the script and displayed on WaniKani websites.**

### Credits
The original is made by Sinyaven, I just very slightly tweaked it so that images lying on a Github page could be used.

#### Prerequisites
The WaniKani Open Framework (wkof) is needed to run this userscript.
