# WaniKani AI Mnemonic Images (Userscript)

### Features
Adds AI images from <a href="https://community.wanikani.com/t/wanikani-mnemonics-in-image-form-done-by-ai/57910">this WK thread<a> to WaniKani info pages, as well as lessons and reviews.

### Images
**Images that are uploaded here are used by the script and displayed on WaniKani websites.**

Naming scheme:

* please upload '.jpeg' images if possible ('.jpg', '.png', '.gif', and '.webp' also work in newer versions of the script)
* for kanji and vocabulary make the file just the kanji/vocab and upload it into the corresponding folder (example: 'images/kanji/é­”.jpeg')
* for radicals name them after their first meaning in all lowercase (example: 'images/radicals/barb.jpeg')

### Credits
The original is made by Sinyaven, I just very slightly tweaked it so that images lying on a Github page could be used.

### Prerequisites
The WaniKani Open Framework (wkof) is needed to run this userscript.
